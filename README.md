Among Us is video game about a group of individuals who are working on a broken ship and they have certain tasks to do to succeed in fixing the ship and win.
all good right? Well no, the only problem is that there is an imposter among them who does not want the ship fixed and his only goal is to sabotage and stop players.
Our main project idea is to use what we have learned about microcontrollers and sensors to take the game to another level and implement it in real life.
